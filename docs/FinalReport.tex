\section{Introduction}
In this document we will be describing our solution and explaining how we fulfilled the challenge proposed by the project specification.\\
We will start by explaining the problems faced, as well as detailing the project requirements during the implementation of this project and then we detail the protocol that we used for implementing a distributed
file system on top of a Kademlia peer-to-peer network overlay. Followed by an evaluation of the system and an explanation of all our choices made in the duration of this project.
